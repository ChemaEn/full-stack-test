The challenge is to build a very simple blog with this specifications:

* The blog should have a header and three posts.
* The html should be rendered on the browser, you can use javascript or a framework. For example [react.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) or [angular.js](https://angularjs.org/), you shouldn't use jquery.
* An api rest for getting the data of the posts.
* For the backend you can use any language/framework that you like. We are currently using nodejs.
