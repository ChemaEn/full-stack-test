## Challenge

The challenge is to build a very simple blog with this specifications:

* The blog should have a header and three posts.
* The html should be rendered on the browser, you can use vanilla javascript or a framework. For example [react.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) or [angular.js](https://angularjs.org/), you shouldn't use jquery.
* An api rest for getting the data of the posts.
* For the backend you can use any language/framework that you like. We are currently using nodejs.


**Optional:**

* Use a build system for the frontend, for example [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) or [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
* Deploy the app, you can use something like [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/es/).
